### JavaScript Frameworks and Resources

+ [Speaking JavaScript - Dr. Axel Rauschmayer](http://speakingjs.com/es5/) 
This book has been written for programmers, by a programmer. So, in order to understand it, you should already know object-oriented programming, for example, via a mainstream programming language such as Java, PHP, C++, Python, Ruby, Objective-C, C#, or Perl.
Thus, the book’s target audience is programmers who want to learn JavaScript quickly and properly, and JavaScript programmers who want to deepen their skills and/or look up specific topics.


+ [Eloquent JavaScript 2nd edition - Marijn Haverbeke](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)
This is a book about JavaScript, programming, and the wonders of the digital. 


+ [JavaScript Allongé - Reginald Braithwaite](https://leanpub.com/javascript-allonge/read)
JavaScript Allongé is a book about programming with functions, because JavaScript is a programming language built on flexible and powerful functions. JavaScript Allongé begins at the beginning, with values and expressions, and builds from there to discuss types, identity, functions, closures, scopes, and many more subjects up to working with classes and instances. In each case, JavaScript Allongé takes care to explain exactly how things work so that when you encounter a problem, you’ll know exactly what is happening and how to fix it.


+ [JavaScript Enlightenment - Cody Lindley](https://leanpub.com/javascript-allonge/read)
This book is not about JavaScript design patterns or implementing an object-oriented paradigm with JavaScript code. It was not written to distinguish the good features of the JavaScript language from the bad. It is not meant to be a complete reference guide. It is not targeted at people new to programming or those completely new to JavaScript. Nor is this a cookbook of JavaScript recipes. Those books have been written.


+ [JavaScript Spessore - Reginald Braithwaite](https://leanpub.com/javascript-spessore)
JavaScript Spessore will show you how to build ES5 JavaScript programs that scale in code, in time, and across a team, using the one technique that has passed the test of time: Objects and metaobjects that have a single responsibility, are decoupled from each other, and can be composed freely.

+ [You Don't Know JS (Book Series) - Kyle Simpson](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)
This is a series of books diving deep into the core mechanisms of the JavaScript language.

### typeScript 

+ [TypeScript Deep Dive - Basarat Ali Syed](https://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/content/docs/getting-started.html) -
The definitive guide to TypeScript and possibly the best TypeScript book :book:. Free and Open Source.
 This is based on the lessons from StackOverflow / DefinitelyTyped and general engagement with the TypeScript community.
 
+ [TypeScript - Handbook](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Handbook/tree/master/pages) - For programs to be useful, we need to be able to work with some of the simplest units of data: numbers, strings, structures, boolean values, and the like. In TypeScript, we support much the same types as you would expect in JavaScript, with a convenient enumeration type thrown in to help things along.

## JavaScript ES6

+ [The road to ECMAScript 6: New solutions for old JS problems - Leo Lanese](https://github.com/leolanese/ES6_workshop) 
A comprehensible JS ES6+ introdution by examples.

+ [Exploring ES2016 & ES2017 - Dr. Axel Rauschmayer](http://exploringjs.com/es2016-es2017.html)
Covers the latest versions of JavaScript as they are created. It is a book for people who already know JavaScript.

+ [Exploring ES6 - Dr. Axel Rauschmayer](http://exploringjs.com/es6/)
This book is about ECMAScript 6 (whose official name is ECMAScript 2015), a new version of JavaScript.

+ [Understanding ECMAScript 6 - Nicholas C. Zakas]( https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read/ )
A good understanding of ECMAScript 6 features is key for all JavaScript developers going forward. The language features introduced in ECMAScript 6 represent the foundation upon which JavaScript applications will be built for the foreseeable future. That’s where this book comes in. My hope is that you’ll read this book to learn about ECMAScript 6 features so that you’ll be ready to start using them as 
soon as you need to.

+ [Practical ES6 - Nicolas Vebacqua]( https://ponyfoo.com/books/practical-es6/chapters/1#read)
A Practical Dive into ES6 and Maintainable JavaScript Modules — Modular JavaScript Book Series

+ [ES6 Features](https://codetower.github.io/es6-features/)
Does the world need another list of ES6 features? Maybe not, but this one seems very technical in its explanations, which I’m sure many experienced programmers moving to JavaScript will appreciate. There are also lots of interactive code examples used for each feature.

+ [Getting Functional with Javascript part2](http://www.datchley.name/getting-functional-with-javascript-part-2/)
+ [Getting Functional with Javascript part3](http://www.datchley.name/getting-functional-with-javascript-part-3/)
Demonstrates FP concepts by showing how to filter, group, and sort an array of data. Lots of good descriptions, samples, and explanations.

+ [Functional javascript Mini book](https://jcouyang.gitbooks.io/functional-javascript/content/en/index.html)This tiny book may only take you 2 hours to read, but it may take you to a journey of experiencing almost all the functional way of writing code in JavaScript. And It will cover some of the new feature come with ECMAScript 6 like arrow function, pattern matching etc. Further more, I will list the implementations of some fancy typeclasses from Haskell in JavaScript.

+ [An introduction to functional programming - Mary Rose Cook](https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/one/an-introduction-to-functional-programming) Many functional programming articles teach abstract functional techniques. That is, composition, pipelining, higher order functions. This one is different. It shows examples of imperative, unfunctional code that people write every day and translates these examples to a functional style.

+ [Functional Programming - How To](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/functional.html)In this document, we’ll take a tour of Python’s features suitable for implementing programs in a functional style. 

+ [Mostly adequate guide to funcional programming - Professor Frisby]( https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide )
This is a book on the functional paradigm in general. We'll use the world's most popular functional programming language: JavaScript

+ [The introduction to Reactive Programming you've been missing - André Staltz (book)](https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754) - [(Video)](https://egghead.io/courses/introduction-to-reactive-programming)
So you're curious in learning this new thing called Reactive Programming, particularly its variant comprising of Rx, Bacon.js, RAC, and others.Learning it is hard, even harder by the lack of good material. When I started, I tried looking for tutorials. I found only a handful of practical guides, but they just scratched the surface and never tackled the challenge of building the whole architecture around it. Library documentations often don't help when you're trying to understand some function. 

+ [Functional Programming by hemanth](https://github.com/hemanth/functional-programming-jargon)
Functional programming (FP) provides many advantages, and its popularity has been increasing as a result. However, each programming paradigm comes with its own unique jargon and FP is no exception. By providing a glossary, we hope to make learning FP easier.

+ [Functional programming tutorial - ZaninAndrea](https://github.com/ZaninAndrea/functional-programming-tutorial) Practical introduction to Functional Programming with JS

+ [Professor Frisby Introduces Composable Functional JavaScript](https://egghead.io/courses/professor-frisby-introduces-composable-functional-javascript) This course teaches the ubiquitous abstractions for modeling pure functional programs. Functional languages have adopted these algebraic constructs across the board as a way to compose applications in a principled way.
We can do the same in JavaScript. While the subject matter will move beyond the functional programming basics, no previous knowledge of functional programming is required. You'll start composing functionality before you know it.

+ [Why Functional Programming Matters - John Hughes The University, Glasgow](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/miranda/whyfp90.pdf) As software becomes more and more complex, it is more and more
important to structure it well. Well-structured software is easy to write and to debug, and provides a collection of modules that can be reused to reduce future programming costs. In this paper we show that two features of functional languages in particular, higher-order functions and lazy evaluation, can contribute significantly to modularity.

+ [Functors, Applicatives, And Monads In Pictures](http://adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html) 
A funny and educational introduction to functional programming features.

+ [Functional Programming HOWTO - Author:	A. M. Kuchling](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/functional.html)

After an introduction to the concepts of functional programming, we’ll look at language features such as iterators and generators and relevant library modules such as itertools and functools.

+ [Thinking in Ramda](http://randycoulman.com/blog/categories/thinking-in-ramda/)
Series about functional programming called Thinking in Ramda.

This is a straight-to-the-point guide to assembling a JavaScript stack. It requires some general programming knowledge, and JavaScript basics. It focuses on wiring tools together and giving you the simplest possible example for each tool. You can see this tutorial as a way to write your own boilerplate from scratch. Since the goal of this tutorial is to assemble various tools, I do not go into details about how these tools work individually. Refer to their documentation or find other tutorials if you want to acquire deeper knowledge in them.

+ [rachelandrew.co.uk - Grid "fallbacks" and overrides](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/css/cheatsheets/grid-fallbacks)
Defined in the CSS Grid Specification are the ways in which grid interacts with other layout methods. These definitions mean that as soon as an item becomes a grid item, other behaviour that you may have used for older browsers is overwritten. This means that you do not have to completely fork your code and build two versions. Where you do need to overwrite CSS used for older browsers, you can do so inside a CSS Feature Query. This enables safe encapsulation of any CSS you only want a grid supporting browser to apply.

+ [http://yoksel.github.io](http://yoksel.github.io/flex-cheatsheet/#display)
A flex container establishes a new flex formatting context for its contents. This is the same as establishing a block formatting context, except that flex layout is used instead of block layout. For example, floats do not intrude into the flex container, and the flex container’s margins do not collapse with the margins of its contents. Flex containers form a containing block for their contents exactly like block containers do. The overflow property applies to flex containers.
